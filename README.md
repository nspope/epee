This R package wraps C++ code that calculates a variational approximation to the likelihood of the phylogenetic threshold model.

This code is very much under development, and the R interface is currently minimal and undocumented. For examples of use, see the functions `testcase_continuous()` (for continuous traits), `testcase_categorical()` (for binary traits), and `testcase_mixed()` (for mixed continuous-binary traits).
